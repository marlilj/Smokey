Start CAN receiver:
candump vcan0

Send a CAN message:
cansend vcan0 01a#11223344AABBCCDD

Generate and send random CAN messages continuously:
cangen vcan0 -v

Creates a log file and writes continuously to that:
candump -l vcan0

??? - Print logfile in a user friendly format:
log2asc -I candump-2015-03-20_123001.log vcan0

canplayer -I candump-2015-03-20_123001.log

If you need to use another can interface than defined in the logfile, use the expression "CANinterfaceToUse=CANinterfaceInFile".

canplayer vcan0=can1 -v -I candump-2015-03-20_123001.log
